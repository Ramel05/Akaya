## What is Akaya?
Akaya is the Attempt to make a little Multitool, controlled by Voice.  
Because this Project was made cause I'm lazy and bored there won't be regular Contributions.  
And I'm German so sorry for the English, if there's anything you want to help with, just write an Issue.
## Quick Disclaimer
This Project is a private one which I make for my own! I just share that with you, so you can help, get inspired or, later, have fun with this little thing.  
So if there are any Tools/Features you don't like/don't wanna have keep it to you please, thanks ;).
## Features:
>1. A Hash-Checker
>>Wanna know if the File you downloaded has the Hash-Value indicated at the Download Page? That's the Tool that makes it easy for you!
>2. A Mod Changer for Minecraft
>>If you play MC with Mods you may know this: You've got many Worlds, Servers and all these need different Modpacks. It's pretty annoying to change them all manually, so the Tool will have this Feature too. Now some of you could say "Why don't just use \<insert Launcher>? Because some (or a lot) of (private) Packs aren't in any of them, so I just make this Part of the Multitool.
>3. A Spammer
>> Self-explaining. Just don't use it for bad purposes!
